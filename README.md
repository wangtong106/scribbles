lstm: comparing LSTM full gradients across multiple time steps among the following approaches:

1. theano gradient: theano.gradient.grad(E, w) (for calculating derivative of error E w.r.t. weight matrix w)
2. numerical gradient: (E(x+eps) - E(x-eps)) / (2 * eps)
3. Gradient given by Graves and Schmidhuber (2005): dE/dx * dx/dw = delta * y (which is incorrect, because dx/dw â‰  y, because w and y are not in a linear relation, because y depends on w through recurrence
4. New gradient calculation taking into consideration of the non-linearity between w and y
